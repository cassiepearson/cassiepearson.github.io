## **Summary**

---
As a Sr. Software Engineer at Deca Technologies, I developed tools and algorithms for semiconductor package design and electronics manufacturing, using Rust and Python. I also mentored other engineers in Rust, including best practices, modern techniques, and product architecture.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from Arizona State University, where I also led a volunteer project to create a software toolkit for biological research, teaching students how to program in R and Python, plan and manage agile projects, and document software. I have interests in computational math, computer science, and cybersecurity, and I hold a CompTIA Security+ ce certification. I am passionate about solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to innovative solutions.
