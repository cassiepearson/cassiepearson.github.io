## **Postulates - Assumptions**

---

Euclid's postulates are a set of basic geometric assumptions that allow for basic shapes to be formed. These postulates are the minimum necessary set of assumptions required for Euclid's proofs. 

Postulates (Assumptions):
1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point
	- A finite straight line is a line between any two points
2. To produce a finite straight line continuous in a straight line
	- A finite continuous straight line exists
3. To Describe a circle with any center and distance
	- A circle can exist with any radius
4. That, if a straight lines falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side which are the angles less than the two right angles
	- To restate that, two skewed lines will eventually intersect on the side where the angle is acute

## **Notions - Axioms**

---

Notions are axioms for Euclid's Elements. Some sources will cite additional axioms relied on by Euclid for different selected works. Importantly, these axioms do not match modern mathematics. Everything here can be covered by the set of modern geometric axioms. Axioms are important to consider as they provide the boundaries of the universe in which any theorems are true. For instance, Euclid will go on to prove numerous properties of lines and angles within the Elements. However, if those same lines or angles are drawn on a flat plane, then that plane is bent in 3D space and the same theorems are considered, they may prove to be false depending on the surface and the manner of bending. Considering the axioms carefully when applying any of the theorems or propositions stemming from them is important. Anything that changes the boundary conditions may change the truth of the statement.

Notions (Axioms):
1. Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another
	- Transitive property applies to geometry. If two triangles are equal to the same triangle, then they are equal. If A = B and B = C, then A = C
2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal
	- Euclid's statement should be considered in terms of geometry. That is two lines create a line and two rectangles added will create a rectangle.
3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal
	- Similar to the above, subtracting a rectangle from a rectangle leaves a rectangle. Subtracting an angle from an angle leaves an angle.
4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another
	- Two angles of equal pairs of lines are equal.
5. The whole is greater than the part
	- If A + B = C, then C > A && C > B
